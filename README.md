# Python RPG Adventure

This file documents the development of a command-line RPG created with the help of a large language model. It tracks the game's evolution through different versions, detailing the features added at each stage and the prompts used to generate them.

## How to Play

1.  **Run the game:** Open a terminal or command prompt and run the script using `python rpg.py`.
2.  **Create your party:** Choose the number of heroes you want to control (1-3) and select a class for each one (e.g., Warrior 🤺, Mage 🧙, Archer 🏹).
3.  **Explore the dungeon:** Use the `w`, `a`, `s`, and `d` keys to move your party through the procedurally generated dungeons.
4.  **Combat:** When you encounter an enemy (e.g., Goblin 👺, Orc 👹), you'll enter turn-based combat. On each hero's turn, you can:
    *   **(1) Attack 💥:** Perform a basic attack on a random enemy.
    *   **(2) Skill ✨:** Use your class's unique skill (e.g., Power Strike, Fireball, Double Shot).
    *   **(3) Inventory 🎒:** Open your inventory to use a potion 🧪 or equip a different weapon ⚔️ or armor 🛡️.
5.  **Descend:** Find the stairs (🔽) to descend to the next dungeon level.
6.  **Win:** Defeat the final boss (🐉) on the last level to win the game.
